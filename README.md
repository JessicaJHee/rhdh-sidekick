## üöÄ Setup

## üîç Search Command

The main feature of sidekick is its AI-powered search functionality that uses RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to search through knowledge bases.

```

### Interactive Mode

The search command runs in interactive mode by default. After each search result, you can:

- Enter a new query to continue searching
- Press Enter to exit the search session

### Verbose Logging

# Enable debug logging
uv run sidekick -v search "your query"

# Enable trace logging
uv run sidekick -vv search "your query"
```
