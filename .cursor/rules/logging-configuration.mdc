# Logging Configuration

## Logging Setup
- Configure via `setup_logging()` in `src/sidekick/cli/base.py`
- Support both "pretty" (colored) and "json" formats
- Log to console and/or file with rotation
- Control logging level and format via settings

## Logging Examples
```bash
# Environment variables
LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG uv run sidekick example hello

# CLI options
uv run sidekick -v example hello              # DEBUG level
uv run sidekick -vv example config            # TRACE level
uv run sidekick --log-level=TRACE example hello
```

## Log Locations
- **Test logs**: `logs/test-sidekick.log` (automatic during pytest)
- **Application logs**: `logs/sidekick.log` (when configured)
- **Custom logs**: User-specified via CLI or environment variables

## Logging Configuration
- Use environment variables with nested delimiter `__` (e.g., `LOGGING__LEVEL=DEBUG`)
- Support structured logging with JSON format
- Include timestamps and log levels
- Configure log rotation for file logging
- Use appropriate log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL)

## Logging Best Practices
- Use descriptive log messages
- Include relevant context in log entries
- Use appropriate log levels for different types of information
- Avoid logging sensitive information
- Use structured logging for machine-readable logs
