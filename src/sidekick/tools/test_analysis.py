"""
Test analysis tools for the sidekick CLI application.

This module provides agent tools for test analysis. The utility functions
for downloading and processing test artifacts are in utils.test_analysis.
"""

# This file is kept for backward compatibility but the functionality
# has been moved to utils.test_analysis for direct use instead of agent tools.
# The new approach pre-downloads all artifacts and passes them directly to the agent.
